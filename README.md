#2 ⏱ Internship Project Update – Stopwatch Web Application

As part of my internship at SkillCraft Technology, I developed a fully responsive Stopwatch Web Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

💻 Key Features:

✔ Start / Pause / Reset functionality

✔ Real-time time tracking

✔ Clean and responsive UI

✔ Organized and structured code

📱 Works smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

🔹 DOM manipulation

🔹 JavaScript timing functions

🔹 Event handling

🔹 Responsive design principles

I’m continuously learning and improving my frontend development skills. Feedback is always welcome! 

🙌 Acknowledgment

This project was developed during my internship at SkillCraft Technology, where I gained hands-on experience in frontend web development and practical project implementation.
